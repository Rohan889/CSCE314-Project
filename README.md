# CSCE314 Project
Takes in two files and compares the word count of both files. Creates 6 text files named debug1, resultsDiff, resultsEqual, resultsListDiff, and resultsListEqual. 

The debug1 file creates a text file that provides all the words that exist in both files in alphabetical order. The resultsDiff and resultsListDiff provide a list of the words that have appeared a different amount in both files and shows which file the word appears in the most and by how much. The difference being how the values the words are stored.
The same thing can be said to resultsEqual and resultsListEqual but with equal words.
